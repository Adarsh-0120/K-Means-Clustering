# Mall Customer Segmentation

## Overview
* Customer segmentation is a fundamental concept in marketing that involves dividing customers into distinct groups based on shared characteristics.
* By understanding customer segments, businesses can tailor their strategies to meet specific needs, improve customer satisfaction, and optimize resource allocation.
* This project utilizes the K-Means clustering algorithm to analyze mall customer data and identify meaningful customer segments.

## Objective
* The primary goal of this project is to cluster mall customers into distinct groups based on their purchasing behavior and demographic information.
* This segmentation will help the mall management team better understand their customers and develop targeted marketing strategies.

## Dataset
* The dataset used in this project contains the following features:
  * **CustomerID**: Unique identifier for each customer.
  * **Gender**: Gender of the customer.
  * **Age**: Age of the customer.
  * **Annual Income (k$)**: Annual income of the customer in thousands of dollars.
  * **Spending Score (1-100)**: A score assigned by the mall based on customer spending behavior and loyalty.

## Technologies Used
* **Programming Language**: Python
* **Libraries**:
  * NumPy: For numerical computations
  * Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis
  * Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization
  * Scikit-learn: For implementing the K-Means clustering algorithm
* **Google Colab Notebook**: For interactive data analysis and visualization

## Goal
* The project aims to achieve the following:
  * Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset.
  * Preprocess the data to ensure it is suitable for clustering.
  * Apply the K-Means clustering algorithm to group customers into segments.
  * Visualize the clusters and interpret the results to provide actionable insights.
  * Document the entire workflow to enable reproducibility and better understanding.

## Repository Structure
* **Dataset**: Contains the input data file used for analysis.
* **Notebook**: Includes the Jupyter Notebook with the step-by-step implementation of the project.
* **README.md**: Project documentation.
